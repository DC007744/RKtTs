# MCP Settings Fix

The issue with your `mcp_settings.json` file is that there's a trailing comma after the URL value and an empty line inside the object. In JSON, trailing commas are not allowed, which is causing the "invalid MCP settings" error.

## Current File (Invalid)

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "server-name": {
            "url": "https://glama.ai/mcp/instances/9ec878j41j/sse?token=fecdd764-8c36-42ed-8b35-6cbe06559ad8",

        }
    }
}
```

## Corrected File

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "server-name": {
            "url": "https://glama.ai/mcp/instances/9ec878j41j/sse?token=fecdd764-8c36-42ed-8b35-6cbe06559ad8"
        }
    }
}
```

The changes made:
1. Removed the trailing comma after the URL value
2. Removed the empty line inside the object

You can copy this corrected JSON and replace the contents of your `mcp_settings.json` file. Alternatively, I can switch to Code mode to make these changes directly if you prefer.

## Next Steps

After fixing the MCP settings file, we can use the MCP server to verify the OpenAI implementation details in the task-06-openai-integration.md file, particularly focusing on the Realtime Audio API to ensure it's up-to-date with the latest OpenAI API documentation.
